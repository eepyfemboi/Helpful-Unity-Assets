# A PNG Avatar generator that I spent too much time on lol

to use this, download the unity package [here](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/Helpful-Unity-Assets/raw/main/eepyfemboi/AvatarTools/PNGAvatarGenerator/PNG%20Avatar%20Generator%20v1.0.9.unitypackage) and then drag and drop it into unity and import everything. Once it's done importing, find the 'Tools' menu on the toolbar at the top, click it, then go to `eepyfemboi > PNG Avatar Generator`.
